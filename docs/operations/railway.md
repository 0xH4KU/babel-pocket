# Railway Deployment

Railway is the easiest hosted self-deploy path for Babel. It keeps the project aligned with the original model: every server owner runs their own bot instance, brings their own Discord token and AI provider credentials, and pays Railway/API usage directly instead of paying Babel for a hosted subscription.

> Railway template links may support Babel maintenance through Railway's template kickback program. Babel remains free and open source; sponsorship or affiliate attribution does not unlock private features.

## One-Click Template Status

The repository is Railway-ready:

- `railway.json` defines the `/livez` healthcheck and restart policy.
- Babel reads Railway's `PORT` before `DASHBOARD_PORT`.
- Babel binds the dashboard to `DASHBOARD_HOST`, which defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
- The Docker image stores SQLite data under `/app/data` when `BABEL_DB_PATH=/app/data/babel.sqlite`.

## Required Variables

Set these in the Railway template or service variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Discord bot token |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | Strong random password |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `BABEL_DB_PATH` | `/app/data/babel.sqlite` |

Optional variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DASHBOARD_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | `3000` for non-Railway deploys; Railway's `PORT` takes precedence |

Do not put provider API keys in the template defaults. Configure Vertex AI or OpenAI-compatible provider settings from the dashboard after first login.

## Persistent SQLite

Create a Railway volume and mount it at:

```text
/app/data
```

Railway's build system uses `/app` as the application directory, so mounting the volume at `/app/data` persists `babel.sqlite` across restarts and redeploys.

If you use the Docker image on Railway, volumes are mounted as root. Babel's Docker image runs as the non-root `babel` user, so set this Railway variable if the volume is not writable:

```text
RAILWAY_RUN_UID=0
```

## First Boot

1. Deploy the template or connect the GitHub repo.
2. Add the required variables.
3. Attach the volume at `/app/data`.
4. Generate a Railway public domain for the service.
5. Open the public URL and log in with `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`.
6. Complete the setup wizard and configure the translation provider.

Check the public health endpoint:

```bash
curl -fsS https://YOUR_RAILWAY_DOMAIN/livez
```

`/readyz` may return `503` until setup is complete and the configured provider passes its readiness check.

## Updates and Autodeploys

Railway has two different update paths:

- **Your own GitHub-connected service:** enable Railway GitHub autodeploys for the service source. Railway can build and deploy when the selected branch receives a new commit. If available for your project, enable the option to wait for GitHub Actions before deploying so failed CI does not roll out automatically.
- **A service created from the Babel template:** upstream template changes do not force every deployed bot to update. Railway may show that the template has updates, but the project owner should review and apply the update manually. This avoids surprising self-hosters with database, environment, or behavior changes.

Recommended template-user update flow:

1. Back up `BABEL_DB_PATH` or the Railway volume before major upgrades.
2. Review the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md).
3. Apply the Railway template update, or redeploy the latest source if the project was connected to your own fork.
4. Check `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, and the dashboard after deployment.

The dashboard version badge checks the latest GitHub release periodically. If a new release was published just after your running instance checked GitHub, the badge can stay gray for a few minutes until the cache refreshes or the service restarts.

## Register Discord Commands

Register commands from a local checkout:

```bash
DISCORD_APP_ID=your_app_id DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token npm run register
```

Or run the same command in a Railway shell with `DISCORD_APP_ID` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` set. This registers the `Babel` context menu plus `/translate`, `/setlang`, `/mylang`, and `/help`.

## Template Publishing Checklist

Before publishing the marketplace template:

- Use the GitHub repository as the template source.
- Confirm Railway detects the root `Dockerfile`.
- Add required variables with clear descriptions and no secret defaults.
- Add a volume mounted at `/app/data`.
- Generate a public domain.
- Verify `/livez` returns `200`.
- Log in to the dashboard and confirm the setup wizard loads.
- Add a short disclosure that Railway may charge hosting usage and that template attribution may support upstream maintenance.

Railway's template kickback program currently requires marketplace publication. Their docs describe a 15% usage kickback for deployed public templates, with a possible support bonus bringing it to 25% when template questions are handled through the Template Queue.
